Walking speed too slow
Level 2 basically unbeatable
Lots of scenes error out on load (lack of navpoints)
Sometimes "New Game" does the same as "Continue" : when first checkpoint of game is reached
Selection for "Normal Arms" has head icon (Intentional??)
Launching scenes individually in editor doesn't give you necessary parts (not really a bug but would be nice to fix)
