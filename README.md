# SWAP
Welcome to the github for SWAP, a platforming action game created by TEAM HYBERN, a group of teenage software developers working in their free time. For fun and for profit!

SWAP follows the main character's mission to rescue their dog, who has been kidnapped by a nefarious cult and their leader, Connor.

This project's goal is to create a small, single player game, with approximately an hour of gameplay. The advantage of completing SWAP and putting it on the internet is thus:
1. We will be able to show it off to our friends. Making a video game is pretty cool, if you ask me.
2. We can use SWAP for a CV. Having actual software creation experience under your belt is more valuable than simply having completed a course on the subject. Any work we put in now can be used to help us land real jobs. Even if unrelated to programming, the teamwork required to work on a computer game for over a year shows not only good people skills, but also grit and determination.
3. Money! We hope to sell SWAP for $2.99 USD. Our basic sales target is $50. This requires we sell at least 17 copies of SWAP.
