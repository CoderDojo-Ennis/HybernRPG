I was thinking of a way to save the game by having to do an action instead of the game saving automatically. 
How about a small platform with a button on it that you have to grapple hook to. 
Or maybe along the way through the world you have to find a piece of a picture of your dog and each one saves the game.

I was thinkig it would be cool to have collectables and it get enough you get an achievement for each time you complete a colectable.
